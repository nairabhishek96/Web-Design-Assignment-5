The Practo website is an application designed to manage hospitals and facilitate patients in booking appointments and receiving consultations from a variety of medical professionals and city hospitals.

# Bootstrap components used:

1: Navbar: Employed to create a header navbar for the website.
2: Carousel: Used for creating image slides.
3: Card: Used for displaying a list of features for the app.
4: Button: Several bootstrap buttons were used in navbar and forms for submissions.
5: Accordion: Used for displaying frequently asked questions about the app.
6: Navs & Tabs: Used for categorizing the subscription plans.
7: Badge: Used to highlight the most popular subscription plans.
8: Modal: Used to alert users about various matters.
9: Toast: Used to provide users with information regarding form details.
10: Forms: Utilized Bootstrap's form controls and form validation.
11: Tooltip: Used in the newsletter submission button.

The current Practo website includes a home landing page and a subscription page displaying the available plans. The landing page is subdivided into sections, with each section employing one or two Bootstrap components.

The website is responsive and can accommodate various screen sizes by utilizing Bootstrap's responsive design, in addition to some customizations. The subscribe form uses Bootstrap's built-in form validation, and if a user does not adhere to a specific field pattern, custom messages will be displayed. The form can only be submitted successfully once all fields have been validated.
